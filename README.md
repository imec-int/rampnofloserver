code that will be deployed or can be ran on your own server.<br/>
Make sure you install a very recent node version; syntax of npm dependencies is not backwards compatible<br/>
update flowhub.json with correct ip, your user id from http://noflojs.org/noflo-ui/<br/>
Maybe perform `assume-unchanged` on this file so you don't overwrite it.<br/>
run `node node_modules/.bin/noflo-nodejs`.<br/>
Refresh runtimes in noflo-ui and start building<br/>
Graphs are logged in the graphs folder<br/>
